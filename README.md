# Pytorch-challenge-notebooks
My python notebooks for the pytorch challenge and explanations.

- Download the colaboratory extension on google chrome
- select a .ipynb file or .py file
- Click on the extension, it would make a copy of the notebook and open it in colaboratory. 

### I would endevour to add pictures to google drive or dropbox, and link them accordingly.

### If you need any help, with any of the codes, or you have suggestions you can contact me on twitter at "labdeeman77
